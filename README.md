Ruby on Rails web application - two-sided marketplace for sustainable festival clothing and unique costumes.

www.getfancier.com (only built for mobile)

Fancier is a global community of creative people who like to shine and express themselves. We are the first online marketplace specialized in vintage festival outfits, custom-made disguises, and original cosplay styles.

From Burning Man to Coachella, Tomorrow Land or your very own Halloween Party - we've got you covered. We believe that looking fancy doesn't have to involve big budgets or shopping fast fashion.

The fashion industry is one of the biggest threads to the global climate. Reducing, reducing and recycling by buying vintage is a solid way to make a positive impact.
